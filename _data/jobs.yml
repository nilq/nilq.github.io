    company: Codingpirates Game Jam again ..
    description: This time we implemented a game engine, a TCP/UDP server and client, and an online multiplayer platformer arena game in which you throw pets at other players. This was done in one go, no sleep with minimal coffee intake. The jury however found some buggy, memory-leaking(no comments) Scratch demo, more attractive than our masterpiece more interesting. I went home with a headache and a Microsoft exclusive USB.
